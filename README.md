## TokaCards

TokaCards is a fast-paced word-guessing card game inspired by classic party games.
The goal is simple: help your team guess the target word — but each mode changes the rules and the challenge.

TokaCards features three main modes:

**Forbidden**  
Inspired by taboo-style games. Help your team guess the main word without using the five forbidden words listed on the card.  

**Mime It**  
No speaking. No sounds. Only gestures. Act it out and let your team figure it out.  

**Draw It**  
Sketch the word on paper without writing letters, numbers, or symbols. Your drawing skills will be put to the test.

Each mode pushes your creativity in a different way, making every round dynamic and unpredictable.
